            <p>Noah is an Atlanta native, and has lived in the city – or its suburbs – almost his entire life. After
                graduating from a local high school, Noah attended the University of Georgia in Athens. Noah graduated
                Magna Cum Laude with a dual major in Finance and International Business. </p>

            <p>After graduation, Noah moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to work as an analyst for PNC Bank. He worked
                in the Treasury Management group within Corporate and Institutional Banking, where he focused on
                delivering financial technology products to businesses in order to optimize operational efficiencies.</p>

            <p>Noah currently works as an Associate Relationship Manager within Commercial Banking in Midtown,
                Atlanta. As an Associate, Noah is tasked with being an advisor to the businesses he works with. He
                provides industry trends and insights, access to capital, and a variety of products spanning from
                Treasury Management to Capital Markets. Noah’s goal is to ensure the businesses he works with have all
                the tools and resources they need to succeed.</p>

            <p>When he’s not at work, Noah is usually trying a new restaurant, playing golf, watching the UGA football
                game, or working on his website (GeorgiaonmyDime.com). Noah is passionate about finance and technology,
                and is currently attending the Georgia Institute of Technology Coding Bootcamp in hopes of creating a
                career that encompasses both passions. </p>
